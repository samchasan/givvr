  <h3>What is chaff?</h3>
      <p>
        Coffee Chaff is a highly nutritious soil additive created as a byproduct of coffee roasting. It it is the husk of the coffee bean, and during the roasting process it heats up, eventually falling off to be removed by the roaster.

        It is light and fibrous, has high nitrogen content, and contains many other nutrients in trace amounts.
        This makes it ideal for <a href="google.com">composting</a>, <a href="google.com">mulching</a>,

        A single roaster can produce 4,000 lbs of chaff per month. Many roasters have found direct
        outlets for their chaff, but even then they often produce more than their recyclers can take.
